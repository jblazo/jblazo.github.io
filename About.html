        <div class="aboutText"><p>Hello, my name is Jarod Blazo and I am a rising senior at Milligan College. I am studying both computer science and computer information systems, and will recieve a major in both fields when I graduate in May 2021.
            When not working on my coursework, I am usually doing something related to the swimming team, which I am the men's team captain of. I have been a part of the team all of my 3 years at Milligan and cannot wait to continue next fall. <br> <br>

            I am married to a beautiful woman named Maggie (pictured right) as of November 2019, and we live in Johnson City, Tennessee. We love to hike and explore on the weekends, and cannot wait to see what the future has in store for us over the next few years.
