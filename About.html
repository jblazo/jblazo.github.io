            <p>
                Hello, my name is Jarod Blazo and I am a rising senior at Milligan College. I am studying both computer
                science and computer information systems, and will recieve a major in both fields when I graduate in May
                2021. I have worked on a plethora of projects both by myself and with many different groups, including a pandemic prediction AI model, an automated greenhouse system, and the design of a potential 
                tracking system to be used by the Milligan athletic department.<br><br>When not working on my coursework, I am usually doing something related to the swimming
                team, which I am the men's team captain of. I have been swimming competitively for almost 13 years and I have compteted in the national NAIA competition all three years I have been eligible.
                Swimming is a true passion of mine and I cannot wait for the season to start back up in August.

            <h2 class="aboutHeading">About Experience</h2>
            <p>
                Since beginning college, I have worked several jobs and internships to provide a wealth of experience to prepare me for gradutaion. Immediately upon my enrollment,
                I obtained a position in the Computer Science department at milligan as a lab tecnician. The position held duties such as maintaining the current lab machines, building new machines, repairing student's 
                and professor's personal machines, and other miscellaneous tasks. <br><br>

                My first intership was with the Johnson City power company, BrightRidge. At BrightRidge, I was a Customer Service Representative and helped assist customers over the phone with any
                of their account needs. This included filing work orders, transferring locations, changing passwords, or managing payments. I was a part of the customer service team at BrightRidge for the summer of 2018.<br><br>

                Soon after my time at BrightRidge, I got a promotion at Milligan to the Lab administrator, meaning I am now in charge of all of the lab technicians, and am the go between for the department staff and students.
                I hold this position currently as it is a year-round staff position with the department. I will continue to serve as the admin until my time as a student at Milligan is up.<br><br>
                
                I have also worked as a contractor for Siemens, an international german engineering company. I was a part of the system test team there for roughly 9 months and worked on several different
                teams and projects before having to return to school and assume the mantle of men's swimming team captain.

            <p>
                I am married to a beautiful woman named Maggie (pictured left) as of November 2019, and we live in
                Johnson City, Tennessee. Maggie is from South Carolina and also competes on the swimming team here at Milligan. She is a several time NAIA all american, and is a hard worker in and out of the pool.
                She also has two majors: business and communications, and works in the center for calling and career. We love to hike and explore on the weekends, and cannot wait to see what the
                future has in store for us over the next few years.
